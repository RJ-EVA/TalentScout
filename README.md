This project is a simple application built to demonstrate practical use of Python for backend development and basic data processing. The goal of this project is to understand how real-world applications are structured and how different components work together rather than just writing isolated scripts.

The application focuses on handling input data, processing it efficiently, and producing meaningful output. It was built as part of a learning and internship-oriented project, with emphasis on clarity, functionality, and correctness.

Technologies used in this project include Python and commonly used Python libraries. The code is written in a straightforward manner so that it is easy to read, debug, and extend in the future.

To run this project locally, make sure Python is installed on your system. Clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the main file. The application should start without any additional configuration.

This project is intended for learning purposes and may not cover all edge cases or production-level optimizations. However, it provides a solid foundation for understanding backend workflows and real application logic.

Future improvements may include better error handling, improved performance, and additional features depending on requirements.

If you’re reading this as a recruiter or reviewer, the focus here is on understanding the fundamentals and demonstrating the ability to build and complete a working project.
